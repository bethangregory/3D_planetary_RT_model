// things to improve/change in code

Near term:
--python fitting routine (get it running fast)
--move finite-difference derivative calculation inside observation_fit
--deuterium and hot H physical densities
--O I 102.6 nm radiance calculation (probably requires frequency redistribution)
--include single-scattering anisotropy

Needed next 6 months:
--IPH background (for IUVS apoapse images)

Small code improvements
  --incoroporate CO2 absorption in holstein function instead of midpoint approximation 
    (needs 2d holstein interps with absorption)
  --use monotone cubic interpolation in brightness calculation
  --fix illumination of zones that straddle the planetary shadow (following Bishop)
  --switch from tabulated holstein T to computing it just-in-time as line integrals are traversed
    (smells like frequency redistribution;
     should be relatively easy, add line profile to tau_tracker)

longer-term:
--more realistic exosphere (Vidal-Madjar or similar)
--frequency redistribution (needs some refactoring of emission object)
--RT anisotropy??

done:
xx--compute voxel densities as average over zone rather than typical value
