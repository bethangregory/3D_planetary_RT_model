// things to improve/change in code

--python wrapper
--IPH background
--fix Bishop formulation (needs 2d holstein interps with absorption)
--use monotone cubic interpolation in brightness calculation
--fix illumination of zones that straddle the planetary shadow (following Bishop)
--deuterium and hot H physical densities
--switch from tabulated holstein T to computing it just-in-time as line integrals are traversed
  (should be relatively easy, add line profile to tau_tracker)
--include single-scattering anisotropy

long-term
--frequency redistribution
--anisotropy??
